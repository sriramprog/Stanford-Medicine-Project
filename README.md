# Improving Nephrology Clinical Workflow Operations Project

## Executive Summary:
Nephrology clinics manage high-risk patients who require timely review of lab results and rapid clinical escalation. This project analyzed real nephrology clinic workflows to identify breakdowns in lab review, role clarity, and escalation processes that can delay care and increase patient safety risk. Using root cause analysis, clinical guideline mapping, and process design principles, the project translated complex clinical rules into clear decision pathways and a role-aware decision-support dashboard. The goal was to improve care coordination, reduce escalation delays, and support safer, more reliable clinical decision-making in busy nephrology clinic environments at Stanford Medicine.

### Business Problem:
The primary goal was to design clearer workflows and decision-support mechanisms that ensure critical lab results are reviewed, escalated, and acted upon promptly—without overburdening clinical staff or disrupting existing clinic operations. This is crucial as nephrology clinics handle patients with chronic kidney disease who are especially vulnerable to abnormal lab results such as elevated potassium levels. In practice, lab values requiring urgent action may be reviewed late or escalated inconsistently due to unclear role ownership, fragmented workflows, and competing clinical priorities. These gaps can delay intervention and increase the risk of patient harm. 

### Methodology:
1. Stakeholder & Role Mapping
I mapped the core stakeholders involved in nephrology clinic operations—including physicians, nurses, advanced practice providers, and care coordinators—to understand how responsibilities for lab review, escalation, and patient follow-up were distributed. This step surfaced role boundaries, workload pressures, and coordination gaps that can delay action on abnormal lab results.

Core Stakeholders, Responsibilities, and Pain Points:
1. Physicians (MD / Nephrologist)
Primary Responsibilities:
- Final clinical decision-making for abnormal lab results
- Diagnosis and treatment planning
- Oversight of escalation and referrals (e.g., ER, cardiology)

Pain Points:
- High administrative burden reduces time available for timely lab review
- Reliance on downstream staff to flag urgent results
- Risk of delayed awareness when labs are reviewed outside clinic hours

2. Registered Nurses (RN)
Primary Responsibilities:
- Ongoing lab monitoring and initial review
- Patient assessment and symptom checks
- Communication with physicians for abnormal findings

Pain Points:
- Heavy workload and competing priorities during clinic hours
- Unclear escalation thresholds for borderline or evolving lab values
- Alert fatigue from high volumes of non-actionable notifications

3. Advanced Practice Providers (APP):
Primary Responsibilities:
- Intermediate clinical assessment and treatment initiation
- Execution of escalation protocols under physician supervision
- Follow-up on abnormal labs and medication adjustments

Pain Points:
- Ambiguity around when to escalate vs. manage independently
- Limited visibility into lab review timelines across care team members
- Balancing high patient load with timely escalation decisions

4. Patient Care Coordinators (PCC):
Primary Responsibilities:
- Scheduling follow-up appointments and repeat labs
- Coordinating referrals and insurance verification
= Patient outreach and communication

Pain Points:
- Downstream dependency on clinical decisions before action can be taken
- Scheduling conflicts that delay follow-up testing
- Limited clinical context when handling urgent cases

2. Workload Diagnostics using a Real Patient Scenario
Using a common kidney patient case involving an elevated potassium level of more than 6.2 mmol/L, I examined how the existing workflow broke down. Root cause analysis techniques (5 Whys and Fishbone diagrams) were used to identify contributing factors across people, process, technology, information flow, and clinical environment. This analysis highlighted issues such as unclear ownership of lab review, alert fatigue, limited follow-up bandwidth during busy clinic hours, and lack of visual cues for urgency.

3. From Clinical Decision to Logic Translation
To reduce ambiguity in case escalation decisions, globally established clinical guidelines were translated into explicit, step-by-step decision logic, which defined when labs should be reviewed, how patient symptoms and history influence urgency, and which clinical role is responsible for escalation at each step. The decision logic was visualized as a clear flowchart to make escalation pathways easy to follow during time-constrained clinical work.

4. Decision-Support Dashboard and Adoption Planning
Based on the clarified workflow and decision logic, a role-aware decision-support dashboard was prototyped to surface urgent lab results, recommended actions, and documentation requirements. To ensure the solution could realistically be adopted, a change management plan was developed using Kotter’s Change Model, including role-based training, resistance mitigation strategies, and success metrics focused on usage, timeliness of escalation, and reduction in missed or delayed interventions.
